##  What was announced

1. At *BaseCamp 2025*, Base founder Jesse Pollak revealed that the team is **exploring the idea of launching a native network token** for the Base chain.

2. This is still in **very early stages** — no details yet on tokenomics, launch date, governance model, or distribution. ([cointelegraph.com](https://cointelegraph.com/news/base-launch-native-token-solana-basecamp-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

3. If released, the token would be built on **Ethereum**, and Base is working with regulators to ensure compliance. ([coindesk.com](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/15/base-explores-issuing-native-token-says-creator-jesse-pollak?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

4. Alongside this, Base also announced an **open-source bridge to Solana**, aiming to improve cross-chain liquidity and interoperability. ([cointelegraph.com](https://cointelegraph.com/news/base-launch-native-token-solana-basecamp-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

##  Why it matters

* For a long time, Base insisted it had **no plans** to issue a token, focusing instead on infrastructure, decentralization, and developer support. ([cointelegraph.com](https://cointelegraph.com/news/base-launch-native-token-solana-basecamp-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* This shift suggests Base may now want to **incentivize users and developers** via token rewards, grants, or governance, accelerating adoption. ([cryptoslate.com](https://cryptoslate.com/base-officially-explores-native-token-launch-to-boost-decentralization-and-global-growth/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* It also opens the door to speculation about potential **airdrops** or rewards for early network participants — though **nothing is officially confirmed**. ([cointelegraph.com](https://cointelegraph.com/news/base-launch-native-token-solana-basecamp-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## ⚠ What’s still unclear

* **Timeline** — no launch date announced.
* **Token model** — unclear whether it will be a governance token, utility token, staking token, or mixed.
* **Distribution** — no word yet on how tokens will be allocated (users, developers, community, or investors).
* **Regulatory risks** — Base emphasizes working closely with regulators, but legal details are not finalized.
